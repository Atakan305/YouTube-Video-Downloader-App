# YouTube-Video-Downloader-App
It is an application that we can download videos from youtube in mp3 and mp4 format with a few lines of Python code.

First, Install the following required libraries:

--> pip install pafy

--> pip install youtube_dl 

Then import the pafy lib as 'import pafy'.

After that, we must create 3 functions. Respectively, they work on:

1-) getting video details like Title, Total Views, Length and the name of the channel it was published.

2-) download as video (mp4) format function which is getting the best resolution of video and then downloading process.

3-) download as audio (mp3) format function. As in video format, it allows downloading the preferred video in audio format from youtube with the best audio features. 
Also with this function, we can get the details of the related video. 

Then I wanted to create if condition and made a instance.
